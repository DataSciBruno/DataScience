# Naive Bayes for Stocks
This repository contains a Python script that applies the Naive Bayes algorithm to analyze stock data. It calculates historical volatility, performs data analysis, and estimates implied volatility for options pricing.

## Dependencies
The script requires the following dependencies:

numpy
pandas
yfinance
datetime
py_vollib

## Usage
Input the start date and ticker symbol when prompted.
The script will download stock data from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library.
Data analysis and calculations will be performed, including historical volatility and probability calculations.
You will be prompted to input option details, including option price, strike price, days to maturity, and option type (call or put).
The script will calculate the implied volatility using the Black-Scholes model and print the result.
Note: Make sure to modify the code to input your desired stock ticker and start date.
